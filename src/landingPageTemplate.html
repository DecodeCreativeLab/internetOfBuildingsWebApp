                In the wake of the global pandemic and in anticipation of the inevitable climate emergency, it is the
                perfect moment to radically redefine how we perceive, conceive and construct our urban environment. The
                Internet of Buildings studio combines computational urban design, data analytics, integrated simulation
                and
                interactive interfaces to understand and propose solutions for the future challenges of our cities.
            </p>

                Focusing on Barcelonaâ€™s Poblenou district, the studio works as a transdisciplinary project team and
                follows
                a multi-layered, multi-scalar and inter-temporal approach. The five major clusters of analysis (urban
                morphology, environmental ecology, energy exchange, mobility flow and social economy) are studied in
                different scales both in space (from building to districts) and in time (current, imminent and future
                challenges).
            </p>

                The Internet of Buildings studio is part of the Master in City & Technology course at the Institute for
                Advanced Architecture of Catalonia.
